                        <h3>Mug Coffee cake</h3>
                        <p>This Mug Coffee Cake is the ultimate single-serving indulgence for coffee lovers. Start with a rich, fluffy cake batter infused with your favorite brewed coffee. The cake bakes right in the mug, creating a warm, comforting treat that’s perfect for when you need a quick, sweet fix. A swirl of chocolate chips or a sprinkle of cinnamon adds extra depth, while a drizzle of whipped cream or a dollop of mascarpone on top gives it that creamy finish. As the cake bakes, the smell of freshly brewed coffee fills the air, and with every bite, you get a warm, aromatic burst of coffee flavor that’s soft, decadent, and irresistible.</p>
